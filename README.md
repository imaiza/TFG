Scripts developed during my final degree project, "Application of machine learning models to cosmological simulations: learning from hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters".

I also add a report of the work in Spanish, explaining what is the work about and adding conclusions about the work called "IÃ±igoMaiza_TFGTUT.pdf".
